# Weather App

## Overview
This is a simple weather application that allows users to enter a city and state to retrieve current weather data. The application fetches data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it in a user-friendly format. I created this project to learn how to work with API keys and integrate them into a web application.

## Features
- User can input a city and state to get current weather information.
- Displays temperature in Fahrenheit, along with other weather details.
- Utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling the frontend.

## Technologies Used
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Fetch API (node-fetch)
- Tailwind CSS
- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your local machine.
- A free API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/).

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-app.git
    cd weather-app
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your OpenWeatherMap API key:
    ```plaintext
    API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key
    ```

4. Start the server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage
1. Enter a city and state in the input fields.
2. Click the "Get Weather" button.
3. View the current weather information displayed on the page.

## Learning Outcomes
This project was developed to enhance my understanding of:
- Working with API keys and making HTTP requests.
- Building a simple backend using Node.js and Express.
- Using Tailwind CSS for responsive and modern UI design.
- Handling form inputs and dynamically updating the DOM with JavaScript.
